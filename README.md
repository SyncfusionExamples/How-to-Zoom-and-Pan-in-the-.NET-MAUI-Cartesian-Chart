# How-to-Zoom-and-Pan-in-the-.NET-MAUI-Cartesian-Chart

This repository contains a sample project demonstrating how to implement zoom and pan functionality in the .NET MAUI Cartesian Chart.

## Zoom and Pan
The .NET MAUI Cartesian Chart provides a powerful way to visualize data with enhanced interactivity through zoom and pan functionalities. This sample demonstrates how to enable zooming and panning in a Cartesian chart to allow users to interact with and closely examine the chart data.

**ZoomPanBehavior:** Adds zoom and pan capabilities to the chart.

**EnableSelectionZooming:** Allows the user to zoom into a selected area of the chart.

**SelectionRectFill:** Sets the fill color of the selection rectangle used for zooming.

**SelectionRectStroke:** Sets the border color of the selection rectangle.

**SelectionRectStrokeWidth:** Specifies the thickness of the selection rectangle's border.

By utilizing these properties, you can create a highly interactive chart that allows users to focus on specific data points and navigate through the chart with ease.
